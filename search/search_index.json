The guidelines link to two additional spreadsheets, explained further below: a detailed site-specific expenses spreadsheet to be filled as part of the submission, synchronized with the bid document; a task-list spreadsheet, which details many of the tasks involved in hosting the conference and suggests several options for delegating a varying amount of the work to the ACL office (acl at aclweb.org) and/or to a professional conference organizer. Preliminary and Final Bids You are first requested to submit a preliminary bid. Promising bidders will be asked by the Conference Coordinating Committee to provide additional information and turn their bid into the final one, according to the schedule published in the Call for Bids. The purpose of a preliminary bid is to give the committee a detailed description of the organization, venue, and setting. The first round of review will help bidders to create a stronger bid, which is better tailored to the needs of the ACL. The purpose of the final bid is to convince the committee that the organizers are capable of running a large scientific conference with considerable professionalism and attention to detail. Covering Letter Include a cover letter addressed to the ACL, naming venue and possible dates, identifying contact person(s) and contact details, signed. Organization Local Organizing Committee : Please name the members of the local organizing committee, including titles and affiliations. For each person, provide a statement about their activities in the CL community and their experience in organizing scientific events (and the number of participants at those events). Local CL Community : Describe the profile of the local CL community, including any research groups, graduate programs, professional bodies, companies. Professional Conference Organizer : It is typically advisable to involve a Professional Conference Organizer (PCO) for the local organization, while the amount of work delegated to the PCO might vary. Where geographically appropriate, the ACL office might take responsibility for typical tasks of a PCO. Specify (roughly) the intended split of tasks between the local organizers, a PCO and/or the ACL office (see the Task List Spreadsheet section below for detail). Identify the organization that will be responsible for such tasks as local arrangements, including venues, catering, accommodation, the social program, and finances. What is the scale of their operation? List major scientific meetings organized recently by the PCO and their size. Dates : Bidders should indicate one or more options for the conference dates. Sometimes, additional alternatives might be explored when negotiating with the committee. When planning the dates please check first with the conference committee chair for the latest known constraints for that year, such as dates of related conferences. Venue Conference : Describe the main auditorium, theatres for 6-7 parallel sessions, spaces for tutorials and workshops, large exhibit area or ballroom for posters/demos/exhibits/coffee breaks, and an option for meeting rooms on-demand. Describe capacity, seating style, A/V facilities, sloping vs level floor, availability of (fold-out) tables in theatres, ceiling height (especially in the smaller workshop and tutorial rooms). Workshops - capacity for 3 two-day workshops, and 20-26 one-day workshops (13-16 per each day) Tutorials - eight tutorials, half in the morning and half in the afternoon (4 rooms) Dates for which the venues have been booked. Accommodation : List categories of accommodation, considering students as well, and their approximate capacities and prices. State the proximity of the accommodation to the conference venue, and the means of access. Dates for which room blocks have been tentatively reserved, or are available. Food and Social Program : Describe plans for breaks (2 per day, mid-morning and mid-afternoon), student lunch (can be off-site; for at least 100-150 students), welcome reception (for about 50-60% of expected attendance), and social event (typically 40-50% of expected attendance). Provide a preliminary plan of the types/quantities of foods per participant to be provided at each of these events, matching their cost in the site-specific expenses spreadsheet. Estimated Costs Summary : Provide a one-page summary of the site-specific expenses spreadsheet (see below), specifying approximate total cost for each component of the conference (main conference, tutorials, workshops, social program, overheads) and the VAT situation (or similar taxes \u2013 see comment in expenses spreadsheet). Please give figures in both local currency and US dollars, and specify the exchange rate. Include any further relevant explanations for your expenses spreadsheet. Setting Map : Provide a detailed map showing positions of venues and accommodation, and other relevant locations (if any \u2013 e.g. food courts, subway/bus stops). Food : Describe the eating options within and near the conference venue. City : Describe the city and region, and the principal attractions. What is the climate at this time of year? Any optional social program. List public cultural events scheduled for the conference period. Transportation : Describe the air and ground transportation that provides access to the city. What is the commute time from regional airport(s) and railway stations to the venue? Extras (Not needed for preliminary bid) Letters of support Photographs of venues and regional attractions Evidence of sponsorship Information about visa, driver licenses Site-Specific Expenses Spreadsheet Site-specific expenses should be detailed in a separate Expenses spreadsheet with which the bid document should be consistent. The spreadsheet includes only items which vary from one venue to another. Costs which are largely fixed across venues (such as proceedings and invited speakers) are omitted, and so are all aspects of income except for local sponsorships. The final budget will be coordinated with the ACL Treasurer and business office. Do not change the spreadsheet in any way, except to populate the yellow and blue cells with your local data. It is important that all bidders submit comparable spreadsheets (as live .xls files, not .pdf). If for some reason you feel that you need to modify the spreadsheet to fit your local conditions, please seek the advice of the Coordinating Committee Chair and the Treasurer before doing so. Most items in the spreadsheet are self-explained or include explanatory comments. Here are some additional guidelines: Some expenses will have both a constant component and a per-person component, and each line of the spreadsheet includes both components. For example, the social event might have a base cost for the venue rental plus a per-person cost as well. In most cases, however, only one component will be non-zero. Complete the spreadsheet in your local currency, and provide a multiplicative conversion factor for USD in the appropriate cell, along with the date on which the exchange rate was valid. The spreadsheet total costs are computed using both conservative (lower-bound) assumptions for the size of the conference and optimistic (upper-bound) assumptions, as specified in the first lines of the spreadsheet. However, when considering venue and accommodation capacities, only upper-bound assumptions should be made, as specified in the relevant spreadsheet lines (there might be some flexibility here according to actual conditions, e.g., possibly not all rooms for parallel sessions will reach the maximal session capacity). With respect to overall cost for the social event, the ticket price should typically not exceed USD 75. Beyond that attendance drops off, which pushes the per-person cost even higher because of constants such as venue rental, risking a serious loss. Equipment-related costs should include security arrangements, if relevant. If you find any problems or bugs in the spreadsheet, please notify David Yarowsky (ACL Treasurer). Task List Spreadsheet As mentioned above, the organizers may choose to delegate a varying amount of the organization work to a Professional Conference Organizer (PCO) and/or to the ACL Office. As auxiliary information for your task planning, we supply a task list spreadsheet (File:Tasklist.xlsx). The spreadsheet lists many of the organization tasks and specifies three prototypical models for sharing the organization load. Option A represents the maximum amount of work for the local organizers, while Option C is the least amount of work. B is in between. Please indicate, in the PCO section of the BID, which of these three models captures best your preferred model and include relevant explanation as needed. The precise details of who does what will be further discussed with promising bidders, you are not committing to specific tasks at this point. The expenses items under the administration section, and particularly Conference Management Fees, should correspond to the cost of work planned for a PCO and/or the ACL office. Please discuss directly with the ACL office the plans and costs. Additional Information Further relevant information may be found at the ACL Conference Handbook and Policies . Successful sample bids for previous conferences may be found at the Bids Archive (follow the current guidelines when preparing your bid). For any queries please contact the Coordinating Committee chair. Evaluation of Bids Proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria (unordered): Experience of local arrangements team Local CL community support Local government and industry support Accessibility and attractiveness of proposed site Suitability of proposed dates Adequacy of conference and exhibit facilities for the anticipated number of registrants Adequacy of residence accommodations and food services in a range of price categories and close to the conference facilities Adequacy of expense projections Geographical balance with regard to prior ACL and other CL meetings in the region.","title":"Bid Guidelines"},{"location":"bid_guidelines/#bid-guidelines","text":"This page provides guidelines for preparing a bid for hosting the ACL conference.

You should have a nice little writeup that calls attention to all of these events. Get someone to write the local guide. These are best when they're personalized by people who know the area. For a great example, see the ACL 2014 handbook (http://acl2014.org/handbook-acl2014.pdf). Get ads from all sponsors, sized appropriate to their classification (gold, silver, etc). These go in the end of the handbook (from the ACL Office). Get hotel maps for inside front cover (from the ACL Office). Pester the GC and PC Chairs for their introductory letters. Think if there is anything cool and new you'd like to add. The main thing you care about is the printer deadline (usually OmniPress), which the ACL Office has pegged at roughly T\u20134 weeks. Work that out with your OmniPress contact. Schedule the week before this deadline to dedicate mostly to handbook assembly. Gather your patience for dealing with inexperience workshop chairs. Send reminders to workshop chairs about the book deadline, which should be roughly T\u20135 or T\u20136 (if you can manage it). Workshops are a bit easier to format but see the notes in the linked guide above about getting workshop chairs to use the proper formatting in the order file. In the end, it doesn't quite matter, because workshops aren't printed out in that much detail. The hardest thing is the main conference. You have to incorporate TACL/CL papers.

They are putting together the proceedings, which contain the schedule, but only print it flat, similar to the way the handbooks print workshops schedules. YOU (the handbook chair) need a properly formatted, machine-readable \"order\" file, because you have to pull out times and paper descriptions in order to build daily and session overviews.

The first, a more frequently used plan, is running large, combined sessions that are typically held in the evening after talk sessions are over. Usually light dinner and drinks are served during these sessions. An alternative plan is to run poster sessions parallel to the talk sessions throughout the day. Both types have been used successfully in the past conferences. The following guideline, written for the first type of poster sessions, is thanks to Michael Strube, the program co-chair of ACL 2015. Below this is a more recent experience from ACL 2018 which describes another compelling layout, thanks to Trevor Cohn, local co-chair. Tips from ACL 2015 In recent years the poster session at ACLs has become increasingly important. About half of the papers are presented as posters. However, the general perception is that a poster presentation is less worth than an oral one. In order to do away with the \"poster stigma\" (an expression borrowed from the TACL editors-in-chief), we should organize poster sessions in a way that authors and audience will have the best experience possible. The following guidelines have been developed by observing the almost perfect poster session at ACL 2014 and evaluated by implementing the guidelines at ACL-IJCNLP 2015. Space and Time Most importantly, It is critical to ensure that sufficient space and time will be allocated for poster presentation. Space and time required are a function of the number of posters and the number of conference attendees. Recent ACLs had about 200 poster presentations (long and short papers, TACL papers, demos, SRW papers). These should be split into two poster sessions of about 100 posters, three hours each. The conferences had between 1100 and 1400 attendees. Hence we had one poster per 10 to 13 attendees per session. A poster should have enough space to accommodate the presenter and about (at least) five attendees. Also, attendees should be able to walk through the poster isles and browse posters without bumping into each other. This requires that each poster occupies a virtual box of about four by four meters, hence each poster requires about 16 square meters (please see the drawing below, artwork by Strube). For a poster session with 100 posters we need a room of about 1600 sqm. If food and drinks are served within this room, we need to add another 800 sqm, hence we need about 2400 sqm. When computing the space, we should also be careful about unusable space. For example, if there is a stage in the room for oral sessions, this most likely can't be removed but occupies a lot of space, emergency exits may occupy space along the walls. Other Considerations Posters have to be arranged by subject area so that attendees easily find the posters they want to explore in detail. Landscape orientation is preferred over portrait, because it allows more attendees to look at one poster simultaneously. An open space between posters allows for easier access to posters and makes a nicer atmosphere. Avoid creating closed isles. A three hour poster session with 100 posters is not the same as two 1 1/2 hour poster sessions with 50 posters each. The poster per attendee ratio changes dramatically. It won't work. Avoid putting events with conflicting setup (oral session, poster session, social event) in the same room, as the time to remove chairs, to set up and remove poster boards may be too long to allow for a smooth schedule. Serve beer during the poster session. Or else, workshop chairs will use the opportunity and make fun of the main conference poster session! Work closely together with the ACL Office as -- in contrast to us -- it knows what it is doing. Tips from ACL 2018 In ACL 2018 we had a large room for poster presentations and needed to accomodate many posters, to handle the growing numbers of papers at ACL. But we shared the poster room with exhibitors and several catering stations. The 16m2 per poster recommendation from ACL 2015 wasn't going to be possible, nor were long rows of poster boards. The layout ideally allows: Easy access to posters, so they can be viewed from a distance or up close A popular poster shouldn't crowd out nearby posters Easy routes for walking between posters, e.g., when overhearing a conversation nearby, can join in easily Flexibility to incorporate pillars, access doors, catering stations and other odd room shapes Make optimal use of limited floor space Our solutions was to have many triangles of poster boards, each housing three landscape posters facing outwards. This means that the viewing area for each poster doesn't impinge on the viewing area for other posters in the group, unlike what happens when they are side-by-side in a row of poster boards. We arranged each poster triangle so that the points of the triangle were directed towards the face fo posters on neighbouring triangles. (Confused? See sketch below.) This was so that the crowd around one poster didn't spill into the way of other nearby posters, which often happens when there are narrow rows of posters. The illustration shows each poster board in red, each of which is 1.4m across, leading to 12m2 space per poster. The black hexagons are simply guide-lines showing the \"virtual box\" for each cluster of posters, and from this pattern it's easy to extend the poster area by simply adding additional hexagons. It does require some geometry, and can be tricky to communicate to the conference venue, but it's worth the effort! Note that the pattern changes slightly at the walls, and sufficient space is needed to ensure that the wall mounted posters are still accessible. Pros/cons. When you can justify 16m2 per poster, then the ACL15 method above is probably best, so long as you put regular gaps between boards to let people get between corridors. This has the advantage of allowing people to cruise the posters more quickly, and see if anything piques their interest without feeling compelled to engage. The triangle layout makes it a bit harder to do this cursory scan. However it can make more efficient use of smaller rooms, incorporate obstacles (e.g., pillars in middle of triangles), and encourage more engagement with posters, as it is more intimate. It also supports more natural grouping of clusters of similar papers more coherently, rather than having them in a long line. It's also easier to spot people in the poster venue, as there are fewer interruptions to sight lines.","title":"Local organization - arranging the poster presentations"},{"location":"local_poster/#local-organization-arranging-the-poster-presentations","text":"There are two common ways of organizing poster sessions.

Often, this team consists of (around 30) students who volunteer to help in exchange for free conference registration. In the past, these students have been local to the conference site. Other times, student recipients of grants from the Walker Fund, or of other travel money, are volunteers. It is important to clarify who is required to register and on what terms. Local student and faculty volunteers play a crucial role in most ACLs, both before and during the conference. Some student volunteers will be non-local, and will do all their work during the conference. Others will be local, and may do some substantial proportion of their volunteer work before the conference; for example by helping with the preparation of booklets and similar, handling aspects of general planning, creating logos, and so on. Local staff or faculty other than the Local Organization Chair may also be substantially involved in various tasks, and should be clearly told whether to register, whether their registration will be paid, and so on. There is a need for a Volunteer co-ordinator who is responsible for planning the staffing of the conference. This involves substantial responsibility and is suitable for a mentally strong and socially confident senior local student or for a local faculty or staff member other than the local chair. Identifying this person should be done early, since the job involves working closely with the local chair and with the ACL secretary. Freebies and Sale Items such as T-Shirts If you have items to be sold, such as t-shirts/polo shirts, etc., put them out for sale on the very first day of the conference. Have people walk around in these shirts early on, if you want others to buy them. People might buy such items on the last day, but they need some lead time to think about the purchase. Freebies (conference tote bags, umbrellas, sunglasses, pens, etc.) are available from specialty houses. Generally, you cannot pay them less than a certain minimum amount, for which you can get many small things or a few big ones.

Other times, student recipients of grants from the Walker Fund, or of other travel money, are volunteers. It is important to clarify who is required to register and on what terms. Local student and faculty volunteers play a crucial role in most ACLs, both before and during the conference. Some student volunteers will be non-local, and will do all their work during the conference. Others will be local, and may do some substantial proportion of their volunteer work before the conference; for example by helping with the preparation of booklets and similar, handling aspects of general planning, creating logos, and so on. Local staff or faculty other than the Local Organization Chair may also be substantially involved in various tasks, and should be clearly told whether to register, whether their registration will be paid, and so on. There is a need for a Volunteer co-ordinator who is responsible for planning the staffing of the conference. This involves substantial responsibility and is suitable for a mentally strong and socially confident senior local student or for a local faculty or staff member other than the local chair.

This includes: managing the reviewing software communicating with the General Chair and the Executive Committee selecting area chairs reviewer selection: either done by program chairs (incl. load balancing) or area chairs constructing and distributing the Call-for-Papers selecting invited speakers overseeing the Best Paper Award (including making a best paper committee) overseeing the reviewing process finalizing the selection of accepted papers deciding on oral versus poster presentation communicating the review results to authors integrating TACL/CL papers whose authors have chosen to present at this conference possibly setting up the mentoring service for authors from countries where English is not the language of scientific exchange creating the conference program, to be publicized by publicity and handbook chairs recruiting session chairs compiling statistics on the conference for the ACL wiki and the business meeting providing updates to the Program Chair section of the Conference Handbook General Guidelines The following are guidelines for the program committee; some of it is extracted from a document prepared by Johanna Moore in 1993 summarizing issues that arose in past program committee meetings and the views of the program committees as to how they should be addressed. Other portions are the result of discussions following recent conferences. Program Committee: ACL has a four-tiered program committee structure: the Program Committee Co-chairs (PC Chairs), the senior area chairs (SAC), the area chairs or senior PC members (AC), and the regular members of the program committee (reviewers). SACs and ACs are selected by PC Chairs. ACL policy prohibits the ACL exec members from serving as ACs (including SACs); for joint conferences with a local chapter, the same restriction applies to members of that chapter's Executive Board. In selecting ACs, consideration should be given to prior experience as a reviewer, having new people as ACs, coverage of the areas of anticipated submissions, and geographical and gender distribution. ACs should be informed of their responsibilites (including the selection of the recipient of the Best Paper Award) at the time they are invited to serve as ACs. Area Chairs can cover more than one area and can overlap areas. In the Call for Papers, some past PC Chairs have preferred not to list the specific areas of ACs in order to avoid biasing the submissions. ACs select reviewers, in consultation with PC Chairs. Consideration should be given to having a balance of experienced and new members of the program committee and geotraphical and gender distribution. The conference proceedings should list PC Chairs, SACs, ACs, reviewers, and any additional reviewers who contributed to reviewing papers, using the headings \"Program Committee Co-Chairs\", \"Senior Area Chairs\", \"Area Chairs\" or \"Senior PC Members\", \"Program Committee Members\", and \"Additional Reviewers\". The names and affiliations for PC Chairs, SACs, and ACs should be given in the proceedings. For reviewers and additional reviewers, only the name is given. All lists should be compiled in alphabetical order. Each reviewer is in charge of the review of 5-10 papers, whereas an additional reviewer reviews at most 2 papers. In the unlikely event that an additional reviewer is asked to review 5 or more papers he or she may, at the discretion of PC Chairs, be upgraded to the status of a regular reviewer. This upgrading process must be triggered by the reviewer who allocated so many papers to a single additional reviewer, by a suitable suggestion to PC Chairs. Regular reviewers may recruit additional reviewers, but the responsibility to get adequate reviews for the allocated papers remains with the regular reviewers. The reviewers report to ACs, and they in turn report to PC Chairs. Additional reviewers report to the reviewer who recruited them. Use of the START conference software: For the past years, ACL has used the START conference software for paper submission, reviewing, and helping with the publication process. PC Chairs should consult with the General Chair and the Executive Committee about whether a contract with START currently exists or whether a new contract should be negotiated. This needs to be settled very early, so that the conference software will be available for submissions. Relevance of papers to ACL: In recent years, a broader range of papers have been solicited for ACL conferences, including papers in information retrieval, spoken language recognition and understanding, tools and language resources, and applications. ACL wants to continue to encourage papers in all areas related to language processing. The authors have the burden of explaining a paper's relevance to the CL community. Mentoring service: ACL conferences provide a mentoring service to help authors, from countries where English is not the language of scientific exchange, produce a fluent paper. PC Chairs are responsible for setting up the mentoring service for the conference. The mentoring service typically is chaired by an individual who is not an AC. The Chair of the mentoring service identifies a set of mentors. Papers are sent to the Chair of the mentoring service some weeks prior to the conference submission deadline, and the mentors work with the authors to improve the communication of their research. The mentoring service should be announced in the Call for Papers and publicized on the conference web site, etc. Paper submission deadline: Every year, PC Chairs receive several papers that arrive after the deadline. Although there have been variations in how such papers are handled, the majority opinion is that the deadline should be strictly enforced in the interest of fairness to those authors who could have improved their papers if they had extra time. The policy on late submissions should be explicitly stated and well-publicized. It is important that the precise time zone for the deadline be clearly stated, such as 5pm Eastern Standard Time. Double blind reviewing: ACL requires that papers be blind reviewed. Consequently, clear instructions must be provided about omitting references that will disclose the author's identify. PC Chairs must decide how to handle papers that violate author anonymity for blind reviewing. In recent years, such papers have been returned to the authors without review. Length/format restrictions on papers: Length restrictions should be stated in terms of font size, margin size, page size, and number of pages. The provision of style files makes it easy for the authors to adhere to these guidelines. PC Chairs should communicate with publication chairs to determine the detailed format restrictions and the style files. PC Chairs must decide how to handle papers that violate the length restrictions on submissions. It is generally felt that length restrictions must be adhered to, and that papers that violate these restrictions should not be reviewed; the basis for this view is that most authors would have liked extra pages to explain their work, but have worked hard to cut their papers down to the requisite length. Thus reviewing papers that violate the length restrictions gives an advantage to the authors of those papers. Double submission policy: Papers presented at an ACL conference must represent new work that has not been previously published. It is the responsiblity of the author to inform the program chair of any potential problem with respect to this requirement, as noted in the following guidelines. Papers that have appeared at a conference with published (archival) proceedings constitute previously published work. Papers that overlap other papers that have appeared at a conference with published (archival) proceedings must contain significant new results. Authors must include on the title page a list of any previous papers that the current paper overlaps or extends, and must identify the significant new results contained in the new submission. PC Chairs have the final decision about what constitutes significant new results. Papers that have appeared at a (non-archival) workshop do not constitute previously published work, as long as the paper submitted to ACL is an extension of the workshop paper. Extensions might include new results, more in-depth analysis, evaluation that was not part of the workshop paper, or further experiments. Authors must include on the title page a list of any previous workshop papers that the current paper extends, and must identify how the current submission extends the previous workshop papers. The program co-chairs have the final decision about whether the ACL submission represents an extension of the workshop papers. Papers being submitted both to ACL and another conference or workshop must note this in submission. (This includes submissions that are extensions of papers currently being submitted to a workshop.) A paper to be presented at ACL must be withdrawn from other conferences and workshops. For details, refer to ACL Policies for Submission, Review and Citation . Authors are expected to adhere to the ACL policy on double submission of papers. However, double submissions that do not follow this policy have been problematic at recent conferences. For ACL-05, the program chairs consulted with the program chairs of other major conferences (such as IJCAI) to determine when authors had submitted to multiple conferences. The submissions were checked, and papers that were multiply submitted (ie., not substantially different) and accepted by more than one conference were rejected from one or both of the conferences. Paper reviewing and acceptance: ACL Policy on Conflicts of Interest: ACL has adopted a formal conflict-of-interest policy . It is essential that PC Chairs, SACs, ACs, and reviewers be familiar with the policy. Submissions by PC Chairs or their students pose special problems. Although there is not an ACL policy prohibiting PC Chairs from submitting to the ACL conference for which they are serving as PC Chairs, PC Chairs and their students are encouraged to submit papers to a different conference to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in the paper acceptance process. Review forms from recent conferences are available. Although the content of the review form is at the discretion of PC Chairs, the ACL executive committee suggests the following in order to provide a good evaluation of application and tools papers: \"Does this paper provide data, software, or source code that will be useful to other researchers in this area?\" \"How useful to the community are any resources released along with the paper.\" PC Chairs and SACs/ACs are responsible for ensuring a high quality technical program. Since the quality of submissions is not uniform from year to year, the acceptance rate for papers may vary from one ACL conference to another. As a guide, an acceptance rate below 20% would be unusually low and an acceptance rate of 30% would be unusually high; however, it is the perogative of PC Chairs to evaluate the quality of the submissions and, in consultation with the General Chair, to determine what is an appropriate acceptance rate for the particular conference. Best Paper Award: The PC Chairs and SACs/ACs are responsible for selecting the recipient of the ACL Best Paper Award and other awards. The Best Paper Award is presented to the recipient, along with a framed award certificate, at the conference. The award selection process should follow the ACL conference awards policy . Visas: To address the visa problem, PC Chairs should notify the authors of submitted papers that if a visa will be needed to attend the conference, authors should do the following: set up an appointment with the appropriate consulate for shortly after the acceptance notification date, and contact the ACL Office for a letter of invitation when the paper is accepted. Documents More documents, including email templates, instructions to SACs/ACs/reviewers, managing START, etc. will be added.

This year\u2019s program consists of 6 half-day tutorials, 100+ talks and 15 full-day workshops. Attendees include students, professors, researchers, software engineers, entrepreneurs from both universities and industry ranging from large companies such as Google, Microsoft, Bloomberg to small start-up companies. Two keynote speeches will be delivered by Regina Barzilay, a professor of MIT and Ehud Reiter, the Chief Scientist of Arria NLG, a UK-based company offering Artificial Intelligence technology in data analytics. We would like to invite you to attend the event. If you are interested in reporting on the event or need more detailed information, please feel free to contact us at any time.

In the unusual circumstances where none of the authors could make it to the conference due to visa issues or illness, an acceptable common practice has been for the authors to arrange a designated speaker who can deliver the talk on behalf of the authors. However, there have been increasing recent concerns regarding traveling bans (e.g., the US government in 2017 tried to impose a traveling ban on Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen), which will likely impact many valuable members of our conferences. Thus, ACL recommends that conference organizers of all ACL endorsed conferences facilitate technical support for participants to present their work and engage with the audience remotely. The exact details on how to arrange technical support will vary depending on the available resources at different conference venues. This article serves as a general guideline. Remote presentation chair : It is recommended that the conference organizers appoint a chair who will be in charge of facilitating remote presentations. The responsibilities of the remote presentation chair include (1) setting up the web applications, (2) reviewing the applications, (3) collecting recorded talks by a predetermined deadline, and (4) coordinating with the A/V support and the session chairs in advance for sessions that include remote presentations. Recorded talks and live QA sessions : It is recommended that the authors prepare a recorded talk by a deadline proposed by the local chairs. The recorded video will be used for the main presentation since real time streaming may not be reliable. The QA session should be streamed live to maintain the interactiveness of the conference talks. Application process : The authors will apply for remote presentation (for each paper separately) via a web application form submitted to the conference organizers by a deadline determined by the conference. To maintain the interactive nature of the conference, conference organizers may consider placing an upper bound on the total number of remote presentations allowed. The upper bound should not be too restrictive, keeping in mind the need to support authors who are struggling with major challenges such as visa restrictions, death in immediate family, major health issues, mobility issues, or other serious issues that impede traveling. At the same time, organizers should carefully examine the applications to allow remote presentations only when there is a compelling reason in order to maintain the interactive nature of the conferences. Another viable alternative to keep in mind, which has been the common practice in most previous conferences, is for the authors to send a speaker who is well aware of the work and can present the talk on behalf of the authors. Especially if the speaker can handle the QA session on behalf of the authors, this may be the preferred option over recorded talks. Yet another alternative that combines the strength of the remote presentation with a substitute speaker is to arrange a speaker who can give the talk on behalf of the authors, followed by an interactive QA session via live stream with the original authors. Selecting presentation modes (oral vs. poster) : The conference organizers will consult with local organizers to determine the viable options with respect to remote oral presentations vs. remote poster presentations. It is recommended that the organizers will consider different preparation requirements for each presentation mode as described below. Supporting remote oral presentations : The technical crews and the session chair allocated for each session will need to be in charge of initiating the playback of the recorded talk and managing the live QA session. Supporting remote poster presentations : The conference organizers will need to allocate support personnel with an appropriate computer for each poster who can be in charge of the playback of the recorded talk and the live QA session. Because poster presentations tend to be more interactive by nature, a potential concern with remote poster presentation is that conference audiences may not find this mode of presentation appealing enough --- especially watching a pre-recorded video on a small screen before initiating a live conversation --- to engage with the remote presenters. Therefore, many participants might engage directly with the presenters via live QA without watching the pre-recorded talks. Due to the potential disruption with the internet connection, however, it is recommended that the presenters prepare recorded talks. Registration cost : The participants giving talks remotely will be required to register for the conference at a reduced cost. The exact amount will be determined by the ACL office and the Treasurer (including chapter Treasurer if applicable), based on data and information provided by the conference organizers. It is estimated that approximately 50% of the charge may be reasonable to share the required charge for reserving the conference venue and technical support. The discounted rate will be applicable only to conference registration. The ACL membership fee will remain identical for all participants. Guidelines for local chairs : The local chairs will work with the venue to probe the available internet speed and the viability of live streaming during the QA sessions. It is important to keep in mind that even if the venue offers high speed internet connection, the streaming can be unreliable if the internet is unstable else where, for example, at the remote presenter's end.","title":"Guidelines on Remote Conference Presentation"},{"location":"remote/#guidelines-on-remote-conference-presentation","text":"ACL conferences have been requiring at least one of the authors to be present at the conference and give a talk in order for their paper to appear in the proceedings.

The General Chair should normally have an affiliation in the geographical region where the conference takes place. Candidates who have already been General Chair of the main ACL conference should normally not be considered again. Candidates with experience only from conferences in related areas, not Computational Linguistics, should normally not be considered. NB : As major CL conferences are counted ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, IJCNLP, COLING, LREC and EMNLP. To aid in the selection process, see this list of past conference chairs Conferences in related areas include, for example, IJCAI, AAAI, NIPS, ICML, ICWSM, CHI, and CSCW.

Once the workshops for a given conference have been identified, the Workshop Chair is responsible for arranging dates, locations, refreshments, presentation and computer requirements, and all other special needs. It is essential that the Workshop Chair recognizes the different kinds of workshops and understand the policies regarding each. There are several categories of ACL workshops: Workshops associated with conferences and formally sponsored by an ACL SIG. Workshops associated with conferences but not formally sponsored by an ACL SIG. Workshops formally sponsored by an ACL SIG but not associated with an ACL conference. Workshops that are neither formally sponsored by a SIG nor associated with an ACL conference. Refer to the following documents to understand the policies related to workshop organization. The ACL General Policies on Workshops provides a set of policies that apply in general to all workshops. The ACL Policies on Conference Workshops provides additional policies that govern workshops held in conjunction with ACL conferences. The ACL Policies on SIG Workshops provides additional policies that govern workshops formally sponsored by ACL SIGs, whether or not they are held in conjunction with an ACL conference. The call for workshop proposals should request that workshop organizers ask potential members of their proposed program committees to agree to serve, before submitting a workshop proposal. Before accepting a workshop proposal, the workshop chair should check with individual workshop organizers to make sure that the proposed members of the program committee have agreed to serve. Large SIGs are expected to seek pre-approval for their workshops. The workshops must be self-financing (at least); profits belong to ACL (an exception is for SIG workshops --- see ACL-policy-on-Sig-workshops ). Sample spreadsheets are available for collecting information about the requirements of different workshops and communicating them to the local organizers. Step-by-step Guide for Workshop Chairs The goal of this document is to describe in a chronological manner the tasks and responsibilities of workshop chairs for ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/EACL/AACL. While each workshop chair might have their idea of how to perform their duties, this is designed to help \u201cautomate\u201d the overall tasks and reduce the overall time needed to perform this important task. Initial Coordination (circa June) Read this document, the ACL workshop chair handbook. Talk to the ACL Office and last year\u2019s workshop chairs to get some initial bearings. Create a mailing list for all workshops chairs of the calendar year (two per conference). This can help researchers reach out to all workshop chairs and aid coordination between the different conferences of the year. Example: workshop-chairs- @googlegroups.com Note: sometimes EMNLP chairs are selected late and some of the initial coordination will be performed without them. Obtain registration and attendance statistics from recent years (through the ACL Office and last year\u2019s chairs). This helps estimate the size of a workshop, which is important when assigning workshops to venues. Venues have different capacities and so it is important to have large/medium/small workshops distributed across venues in a reasonable manner. Find out the layout of the venue (how many rooms and their capacity). Usually there are about 8 rooms of varying sizes each day for the workshops Call for proposals (July-September) Write a call for workshop proposals jointly with all workshop chairs. Example call. First call should go out around July, Second call around August, and final call in September. Submission deadline should be 6-8 months before the first conference of the year. It is advisable to mention in the call that workshops can be 2 days only if they have a large number (>100) of participants for two continuous years. Set up a SoftConf START system through the Softconf support. Tweak the submission interface to your liking. Workshop organizers should make it clear what are their venue preferences and whether there are hard constraints (we will not hold the workshop if it is in venue X). This should be clear from the submission interface. Workshop selection (October-November) This is probably the most time-consuming period for the workshops chairs. Large workshops are pre-admitted: *SEM, WMT, CoNLL, other workshops that will have more than 100 participants (SemEval). However, the chairs need to get their venue preferences for the year. Traditionally, workshop selection was done by recruiting a program committee. In 2016-2017 about 60 workshops proposals were submitted, so this means that if each proposal receives 2 reviews and each committee member reviews 4 workshop proposals, a committee of 30 reviewers is needed. This is a process similar to choosing a conference program. In 2017, we opted for a different methodology. The main reasons were: Criteria for workshop selection is vague and so having a large program committee reduces fairness. Rejection rate increased to ~40-50%. An important criterion is public interest and that is not gauged well in the current model. Instead we performed the following changes: Online survey: Hold an online survey among ACL members (get mailing list from the ACL Office) asking them to indicate which workshops they would likely attend. This process also helps workshop organizers put up a website early and advertise the upcoming workshops to the ACL community. After results of the survey are in, each workshop chair reviews 1/6 of the proposals and comments on them. Then a discussion among all workshops chairs and they jointly decide the selected workshops.

Workshop organization (From December) This part is mostly coordinating with the workshop organizers, general chair, publication chair and conference handbook chair. For most questions related to the venue, registration and ISBN numbers, the ACL Office is probably the best person to ask. For SoftConf related issues, the program chair is the best person to ask. For proceeding and handbook, it is best to email publication and handbook chairs on the same email thread. Consider cc\u2019ing the general chair, program chairs and the ACL Office on some important emails to keep everyone on the same page. Send the list of accepted workshops to the website chair so that they are put on the website. Coordinate with the general chair of the conference to get the important dates for all workshops (submission deadline, notification deadline, camera-ready deadline, proceeding deadline). Check carefully with all publication chairs to make sure proceeding deadline is early enough and has several days for buffer; this is the most crucial date. Decide on a date when the workshop organizers must assemble the schedule and materials for the conference handbook. The material is sent to the conference handbook chair. This is not flexible usually. Towards the deadline (~1-1.5 months before the conference) there is likely to be some correspondence between workshop organizers and the handbook chair about the exact format needed from the workshop organizers. Let the workshop organizers be responsible for assembling the proceedings of their workshop and coordinate with the publication chair. How to instructions. Ask the program chair whether they are setting SoftConf START accounts for all the workshops. If not, workshops organizers need to know they should do it. Write a progress report for ACL executives when asked by the general chair. Prepare a coordination sheet for all the conference workshops. This will contain at least the following information by the end of the conference and needs to be verified by the workshop organizers: Official workshop name Exact name of the proceedings URL of workshop website Abbreviation for SoftConf link (program chair) Contacts for all workshop organizers Number of posters and time when they are needed ACL ID prefix for ACL anthology (publication chair) ISBN: after confirming the exact name of the proceedings, ask the ACL Office to issue ISBN numbers, then rally the ISBN numbers back to the workshop organizers for them to add into proceedings. Announce the size of posters for the workshops (ask the ACL Office about the size; it could be different from the main conference) Usually each workshop waives registration fee for one invited speaker. This can also be managed in the coordination sheet. Coordinate with the ACL Office and announce the schedule for the workshops: start time, end time, break and meal times. All workshops should have the exact time for meals and breaks. This is very important as otherwise it is very hard to coordinate breaks for all workshops. Example: Breakfast 7:30-9:00 am Start time: between 8:30 and 9:00 am Mid-morning coffee/decaf/tea refresh: 10:30-11:00 am Lunch: 12:30-2:00 pm Mid-afternoon Snacks: 3:30-4:00 pm End of day: 5:00-6:00 pm (preferably by 5:30) Remind workshop organizers about the handbook and especially the proceedings deadline (two weeks and four days before due dates) and include handbook and publication chairs in the same email thread. Ask handbook and publication chairs how do they want the schedule and proceedings submitted. Usually you may pass down the instructions from the handbook chair to the workshop organizers; while due to the complexity of proceedings, it is better for the publication chairs to directly send instructions and communicate with the workshop organizers.

Once the workshops for a given conference have been identified, the Workshop Chair is responsible for arranging dates, locations, refreshments, presentation and computer requirements, and all other special needs. It is essential that the Workshop Chair recognizes the different kinds of workshops and understand the policies regarding each. There are several categories of ACL workshops: Workshops associated with conferences and formally sponsored by an ACL SIG. Workshops associated with conferences but not formally sponsored by an ACL SIG. Workshops formally sponsored by an ACL SIG but not associated with an ACL conference. Workshops that are neither formally sponsored by a SIG nor associated with an ACL conference. Refer to the following documents to understand the policies related to workshop organization. The ACL General Policies on Workshops provides a set of policies that apply in general to all workshops. The ACL Policies on Conference Workshops provides additional policies that govern workshops held in conjunction with ACL conferences. The ACL Policies on SIG Workshops provides additional policies that govern workshops formally sponsored by ACL SIGs, whether or not they are held in conjunction with an ACL conference. The call for workshop proposals should request that workshop organizers ask potential members of their proposed program committees to agree to serve, before submitting a workshop proposal. Before accepting a workshop proposal, the workshop chair should check with individual workshop organizers to make sure that the proposed members of the program committee have agreed to serve. Large SIGs are expected to seek pre-approval for their workshops. The workshops must be self-financing (at least); profits belong to ACL (an exception is for SIG workshops --- see ACL-policy-on-Sig-workshops ). Sample spreadsheets are available for collecting information about the requirements of different workshops and communicating them to the local organizers.","title":"Workshop Chairs"},{"location":"workshop/#step-by-step-guide-for-workshop-chairs","text":"The goal of this document is to describe in a chronological manner the tasks and responsibilities of workshop chairs for ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/EACL/AACL.

Talk to the ACL Office and last year\u2019s workshop chairs to get some initial bearings. Create a mailing list for all workshops chairs of the calendar year (two per conference). This can help researchers reach out to all workshop chairs and aid coordination between the different conferences of the year. Example: workshop-chairs- @googlegroups.com Note: sometimes EMNLP chairs are selected late and some of the initial coordination will be performed without them. Obtain registration and attendance statistics from recent years (through the ACL Office and last year\u2019s chairs). This helps estimate the size of a workshop, which is important when assigning workshops to venues. Venues have different capacities and so it is important to have large/medium/small workshops distributed across venues in a reasonable manner. Find out the layout of the venue (how many rooms and their capacity). Usually there are about 8 rooms of varying sizes each day for the workshops","title":"Initial Coordination (circa June)"},{"location":"workshop/#call-for-proposals-july-september","text":"Write a call for workshop proposals jointly with all workshop chairs. Example call. First call should go out around July, Second call around August, and final call in September. Submission deadline should be 6-8 months before the first conference of the year. It is advisable to mention in the call that workshops can be 2 days only if they have a large number (>100) of participants for two continuous years. Set up a SoftConf START system through the Softconf support. Tweak the submission interface to your liking. Workshop organizers should make it clear what are their venue preferences and whether there are hard constraints (we will not hold the workshop if it is in venue X). This should be clear from the submission interface.","title":"Call for proposals (July-September)"},{"location":"workshop/#workshop-selection-october-november","text":"This is probably the most time-consuming period for the workshops chairs. Large workshops are pre-admitted: *SEM, WMT, CoNLL, other workshops that will have more than 100 participants (SemEval). However, the chairs need to get their venue preferences for the year. Traditionally, workshop selection was done by recruiting a program committee. In 2016-2017 about 60 workshops proposals were submitted, so this means that if each proposal receives 2 reviews and each committee member reviews 4 workshop proposals, a committee of 30 reviewers is needed. This is a process similar to choosing a conference program. In 2017, we opted for a different methodology. The main reasons were: Criteria for workshop selection is vague and so having a large program committee reduces fairness. Rejection rate increased to ~40-50%. An important criterion is public interest and that is not gauged well in the current model. Instead we performed the following changes: Online survey: Hold an online survey among ACL members (get mailing list from the ACL Office) asking them to indicate which workshops they would likely attend. This process also helps workshop organizers put up a website early and advertise the upcoming workshops to the ACL community. After results of the survey are in, each workshop chair reviews 1/6 of the proposals and comments on them. Then a discussion among all workshops chairs and they jointly decide the selected workshops.
