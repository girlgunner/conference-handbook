# Diversity and Inclusion Chair


- D&I Subsidies Management: This involves handling the call for D&I subsidies, preparing the application form, and deciding on the allocation of subsidies.
- D&I Information Gathering: We are responsible for gathering D&I information about the conference participants. This involves preparing and distributing a questionnaire, which should be sent along with the conference registration.
- D&I Activities Management: We are to manage D&I activities, such as the Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions at the conference, and coordinate with local chairs for booking rooms. We must also respond to special requests, like borrowing wheelchairs, and work with local chairs to accommodate these.
- Coordination with Other Committees: This includes working closely with the Volunteer Chairs for coordinating volunteers and D&I subsidies, the Publicity Chairs for advertising D&I initiatives, the Website Chairs for updating D&I information on the conference website, and the ACL Business Team for various aspects of D&I initiatives.
